# UIUC CS 225: Data Structures (Self-Study)

I independently studied 'CS 225: Data Structures' from UIUC, utilizing a variety of online resources and comprehensive project work to master the course material.
This repository contains my coursework for the CS 225 (Data Structures) course at the UIUC during the Fall 2019 semester. It includes lab assignments, machine problems (MPs), and other related material.
